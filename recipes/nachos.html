    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Who doesn't love nachos? Despite what was served at 
        elementary school cafeteria lunches, nachos do not 
        have to mean stale chips with a bland cheese sauce. 
        Discovering real nachos is revolutionary! Chips, 
        cheese, meat, beans, veggies, yum! </p>
    <p>History Lesson: Nachos were created by Ignacio “El Nacho” Anaya 
        in 1943 in Mexico. He created a new snack for the wives of 
        soldiers stationed at Fort Duncan, frying cut tortillas and 
        adding shredded cheese and pickled jalapeños. He called them, 
        “Nacho Especiales.”  </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef (80:20 lean-to-fat ratio)</li>
        <li>16 ounces (2 cups) refried beans, canned or homemade</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water</1i>   
        <li>1 large bag of tortilla chips</li>    
        <li>4 ounces cheddar cheese, grated (about 2 cups), plus more for topping</li>
        <li>4 ounces Colby Jack cheese, grated (about 2 cups), plus more for topping</li>
        <li>1 cup pico de gallo, store-bought or homemade, plus more for topping</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped cilantro</li>
        <li>1 jalapeño (pickled or fresh), sliced</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees farenheit</li>
        <li>Make beef and bean topping</li>
        <p>Heat the vegetable oil on medium high heat until it begins 
            to shimmer. Add the ground beef to the pan and season it 
            with all of the taco spice blend. As the meat cooks, use a 
            spoon to break the meat up into crumbles. </p>
        <p>Cook for about 8 minutes until the meat has browned and 
            drain the fat using a colander.</p>
        <p>Return the meat to the pan and add the refried beans and 
            the water. Heat the mixture until the beans are 
            smooth and warmed through. Reduce the heat to 
            low and keep the beef-bean mixture warm while you 
            prepare the chips.</p>

        <li>Toast the chips</li>

        <p>On a 13x18-inch oven-safe platter or sheet pan, arrange 
            the tortilla chips in a single layer, overlapping 
            them slightly. Toast the chips in the preheated oven 
            for 5 minutes, or just until you begin to smell their 
            aroma.</p>

        <li>Assemble and bake the nachos</li>
        <li>Top and serve</li>
    </ol>
